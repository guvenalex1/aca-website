                <p>We are a group of Georgia Tech students who recognized the growing need for educators to understand and effectively utilize AI tools in their teaching practice. Our mission began with the simple idea that teachers shouldn't be left behind in the digital revolution, but rather empowered to harness these powerful technologies to enhance their educational impact. Through hands-on workshops and personalized training, we help educators integrate AI tools seamlessly into their daily workflow, making teaching more efficient and effective.</p>

                    <p>"This was an excellent workshop! I found it extremely helpful - I had no idea this resource even existed and thought it was one of the best AI tools I've ever used. The handout was SO helpful that I have it tacked on my bulletin board. As someone from an older generation who isn't a technology person, most of this initially baffled me, but the knowledgeable and well-spoken team made it accessible. With some practice, I'll be able to use it effectively in my classroom."</p>
